\section{Motivation}

An expanding market of IoT devices requires manufacturers and their engineers to adopt to new standards or rework 
the old ones. The enterprise IoT market has grown by 23\% since 2021 (TODO: źródło). A huge part of this business is taken
by home automation products which wouldn't exist without chips combining power saving designs and wireless connectivity.

This dissertation focuses on two network protocols used mainly by home automation devices: Zigbee and Thread.
Both of them are supported by Nordic Semiconductor's SoC nRF52840. Although these protocols share many features
and are based on the same physical layer- IEEE 802.15.4, their designs and targets are different.
