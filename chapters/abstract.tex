Mesh protocols have been around for about two decades. The problem of having wireless connectivity between embedded 
devices has been approached in different ways by a variety of standards. Two of them: Zigbee and Thread were chosen
for comparison in terms of network stacks architectures and performance. This dissertation provides an overview of
these protocols alongside with the performance evaluation of networks built upon them.
